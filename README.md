# CSharp_Projects

These are a few small projects I've worked on in C#:

TwentyOne - 

This project represents a text-based version of the popular card game twenty-one/blackjack. Within the project, there are many examples of specific conditions being met with different results being displayed using "if" loops.

Car Insurance - 

This project represents a car insurance form which calculates a quote and displays the result to the user. It utilizes the MVC web application, taking in user input and allowing an admin to see a list of quotes previously given to the user(s).
